- when saving node: save file, if selected node and mode=node, apply texture from file
- brush doesnt draws lines, correct it
- ability to do sprite sheets (load_from_sheet-> subdivision image, save_to_sheet->blit section)
- arrange ui better (popupmenu)-> should hide all when minimized
- publish
- quick button add sprite...-> prefill it, same animatedsprite
- pop up that expands drawing area: move child around
- color picker pop up?
