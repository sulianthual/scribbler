- load and save: works but very dirty with not all edge cases
	->make a handle that persists between popups (one for each button) 
- do the drag and drop system: all possible edge cases (PNG files)
	-> should hold the file.png of loaded so we just propose to overwrite it
	-> also show current file in drawing window above dimensions
	-> ability to load as spritesheet by drag and drop (?)
	-> or just load entire sheet, then select subregion
- shortcuts to add sprite2D, animatedsprite2D to scenetree (dedicated popup)
- add replace color: current color replaces all of color below cursor
- test if works when exporting game
- remove detach: can already make floating
- improve error messages
- publish
