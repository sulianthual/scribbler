-  change controls:
	Ctrl+Z or middle mouse: undo (use dedicated undoredo)
	Right Mouse: Eraser version of current brush
	black pen -> erase black TODO
	pen -> eraser (erase all) DONE
	pen behind black -> erase behind black DONE
	pen behind black over color -> erase behind black only over color DONE
	bucket -> fill transparent (behind black) -> DONE
	*also remove eraser button as it is redundant, maybe replace with undo (cf middle mouse janky)
- options (could make a button): 
	grid (finicky)
	background color
	sheet on/off
	onion import (semi transparent or colored outlines)
	-> not fundamental
- drag and drop for size: scale or other (vector2)
- publish
